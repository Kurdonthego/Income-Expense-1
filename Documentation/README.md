# Income-Expense Recorder

### Why was this created?
#### In order to use this code properly you must first understand the code and the purpose. The creator has made this program to help people with bad spending habits. Including those who dont understand what budgeting means.

#### There are many programs out there that would do the same thing however this is the simplest design to ever be created. In less then xxx lines the program can take your Income and Expense and give you a Total Balance. With this being said plans to add a date/time for each transaction are in the works aswell as a function to organize by amount spent, date/time and name.

### Is it scalable?
#### Yes, with more functions it can easily be scalable to accomediate 10 entries or 10 000 entries. With that being said slight modifications may need to be made to your computer as I do not expect even a NASA computer to handle 10 000 entries.

### Instructions on Use
#### To start the code simply press the 'Run' button on the top of the screen or hit Ctrl+Enter to start it. When in the menu you have three options Income, Expense and Balance. When filing an Income it will display as a positive number, Expenses as a negative. The Balance option is the Income minus Expense, If the Balance icon is green it means your Income or money is the positive and if red then vise versa. To stop the code at any given time simply type 'quit' and the program will stop.

### Alpha Testing
#### Originally when testing the code the idea of a bland UI was too basic and the white text hurt my eyes, that is when the idea for a green for good and red for bad was created. In the initial stages aswell the code was very basic and ideas for extras were made like a seperate module for Income and Expense to easily organize the code.
